 * Description: This function runs a command on the system.  The
 * command is started in the background some time after the current
 * probe completes. The command is run with the same UID as the user
 * running the stap or staprun command.  The runtime may impose a
 * relatively short length limit on the command string.  Exceeding it
 * may print a warning.
